- 👋 Hi, I’m @mmz65
- 👀 I’m interested in linux and to a much smaller amount in Windows.  I am working on running linux inside Windows using VirtualBox.
  As part of this I am trying to fix a couple of errors and get multiple monitors plus screens to work correctly in both OS's.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever I need to fix problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:  do not know as I am new to this and I will have to learn more to determine that.
- 📫 How to reach me:  Good Question which at this time has no answer.
